# Discolor

*Convert any image into a low-resolution, color approximated textual representation for use on Discord.*

Discolor is a converter for images that scales them down and converts them into strings of spaces and full blocks with control sequence graphics rendition ("ANSI") codes to change the text color. The text images can be displayed in Discord code blocks by using `ansi` as the language (currently only supported on browser/desktop).
