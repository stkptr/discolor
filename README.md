# Discolor

*Convert any image into a low-resolution, color approximated textual
representation for use on Discord.*

Discolor is a converter for images that scales them down and converts them into
strings of spaces and full blocks with control sequence graphics rendition
("ANSI") codes to change the text color. The text images can be displayed in
Discord code blocks by using `ansi` as the language (currently only supported
on browser/desktop).
